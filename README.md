### Synopsis 
I built the AI image generation project just as a cool thing to share with my family and it happened to double as learning. I conceptualized the MERN architecture throughout October, stumbled through prototypes in November, and was really connecting things come December. I deployed it in January on Netlify, but it did not last long, as I forgot that OPENAI image generation is not free, and all the tokens I bought were gone within the day, but it was fun seeing them interact with it.

### Compile

Download code zip, import into editor, install all dependecies listed (i.e vite) via node.js package manager (npm), provide .env file.

### WIP

Simultaneous 4-image generation
