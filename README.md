### Synopsis 
I embarked on the creation of an innovative AI image generation project with the intention of sharing it with my family and inadvertently gained a valuable learning experience. My conceptualization of the MERN architecture spanned the entirety of October, with a prototyping process in November. However, as December approached, I began to seamlessly integrate the various components of the project. After deploying it on Netlify in January, I was discovered that the OPENAI image generation service was not cost-free (openai billing error) and my purchased tokens were quickly depleted. Still, it was fun seeing them interact with it, and I have retained samples and screenshots of the beginning stages.

### Compile

Download code zip, import into editor, install all dependecies listed (i.e vite) via node.js package manager (npm), provide .env file.

### WIP

Simultaneous 4-image generation
